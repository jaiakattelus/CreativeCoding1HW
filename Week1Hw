A GUI is something most people are used to. GUI means Graphic user interface and is defined by clickable buttons and icons, draggable interactive sliders and other visual 
icons used to navigate a visual space. A CLI is a command line interface that relies on text based commands. GUIs are more user friendly but ultimately limit what you can 
do. CLIs are much more difficult to learn but create more opportunities in programming like automation and you get more access to the lower levels of a system. CLIs are also the 
code behind GUIs as you use CLI to design icons and widgets and the functions we benefit from. That said, CLIs are most commonly used in software development for writing apps, 
games, websites and other programs used by the general public. CLIs are much more lightweight than GUIs because they dont have a graphic interface, it is because of this however 
that mistakes can be easily made. I believe this is the main reason i'll struggle with this program but I am excited to learn. CLI requires that you understand certain commands 
and syntax. These commands are short and cryptic but can complete very complex jobs. I am very excited to see what I can accomplish with CLI this semester.
